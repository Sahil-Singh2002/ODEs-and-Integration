## Numerical Integration

The `composite_trapezium` function approximates the definite integral of a given function $f(x)$ over a specified interval $[a,b]$ using the composite trapezium rule with $n$ subintervals. The composite trapezium rule divides the interval into smaller subintervals, approximates the integral over each subinterval using the trapezium rule, and sums up the results to estimate the total integral. This function is useful for obtaining reasonably accurate approximations of integrals without requiring complex mathematical calculations.

The composite trapezium rule equation is given by:

$$ \int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx \approx \frac{h}{2} \left[f(a) +2\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}f(x_{j})+f(b) \right]$$

where $h$ is the width of each subinterval, $x_{j}$ is the midpoint of the $j$-th subinterval, and $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ are the function values at the endpoints of the interval.

To use the `composite_trapezium` function, you need to provide the function $f(x)$, the interval limits $a$ and $b$, and the number of subintervals $n$. The function will return an approximation of the integral.

The composite trapezium rule is an improvement over the basic trapezium rule as it takes into account the curvature of the function over each subinterval, resulting in more accurate approximations.

By adjusting the value of $n$, you can control the trade-off between computational cost and accuracy. Increasing $n$ will generally lead to a more accurate approximation but will also require more computational resources.

Using the `composite_trapezium` function, you can easily approximate integrals of various functions and evaluate definite integrals over a specified interval.

The `romberg_integration` function performs Richardson extrapolation to estimate the definite integral of a function $f(x)$ over an interval $[a, b]$ using the composite trapezium rule with increasing levels of extrapolation. Richardson extrapolation combines multiple approximations with different step sizes to improve accuracy. The `level` parameter determines the number of extrapolation stages to perform. This function is useful for obtaining highly accurate estimates of definite integrals, especially for functions with smooth behavior.

The `compute_errors` function calculates the errors associated with different numbers of subintervals and levels in the Romberg integration process and visualizes the results in a plot. It takes a range of subinterval values $(N)$ and levels of extrapolation $(levels)$ as inputs and calculates the error between the approximate integral and the true value for each combination. This function helps in assessing the convergence and accuracy of the Romberg integration method for a specific function and interval. The plot generated by this function provides insights into the convergence rate and potential limitations of the Romberg integration method.

## Numerical ODEs - One-step and Multistep methods

One-step methods are numerical techniques for approximating solutions to differential equations, where the value $y_{i+1}$ is computed solely based on the information from the previous time level $t_{i}$. However, there are also multistep methods that use more historical information to determine $y_{i+1}$. A general $m$-step method, with step-length $h$, is shown below:

$$ y_{i+1} = y_i + h \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} a_k f(t_{i-k}, y_{i-k}) $$

for some coefficients $a_{k}$.

The Adams-Bashforth family of methods is a group of multistep methods. The 1-step Adams-Bashforth method coincides with the Euler method, while the 2-step method utilizes information from two previous time points, resulting in a formula for $y_{i+1}$ that includes terms $y_{i}$ and $y_{i-1}$:

$$ y_{i+1} = y_{i} + \frac{h}{2} \left[3f(t_i, y_i) - f(t_{i-1}, y_{i-1})\right] $$

where $h$ is the step size and $y_{0} = f(t, y)$ is the first-order differential equation being solved.

The `adams_bashforth` function approximates the solution to a first-order ODE based on two different methods: Euler's Method and the Adams-Bashforth method. It takes inputs such as the lower limit of integration $a$, the upper limit of integration $b$, the number of subintervals $n$, the method to use (`method`), and the right-hand side (RHS) function $f$. For Euler's Method, it uses a simple forward difference formula to update the approximation of the solution at each step. For the Adams-Bashforth method, it incorporates multiple previous values of the solution to improve accuracy. This function is useful for solving and approximating the solutions to first-order ODEs numerically.

## Numerical ODEs - Second-order ordinary differential equations

Second-order IVPs may be solved numerically by first converting them into a system of first-order IVPs. This method is called reduction of order. Let

$$y'' = f(t, y, y'), \quad a < t \leq b, \quad (2)$$

$$y(a) = \alpha, \quad y'(a) = \beta, \quad (3)$$

where $y(t)$ is to be found. We can rewrite the original IVP as a system of two first-order IVPs by introducing a new function $z(t) = y'$:

$$y' = z, \quad y(a) = \alpha; \quad (4)$$

$$z' = f(t, y, z), \quad z(a) = \beta. \quad (5)$$

This system of first-order IVPs can be solved numerically using the Euler and the 2-step Adams-Bashforth methods which were implemented in the previous question.

The `adams_bashforth_2` function approximates the solution to a second-order ODE with initial conditions over an interval. It takes inputs such as the lower limit of integration $a$, the upper limit of integration $b$, the number of subintervals $n$, the function representing the ODE, the initial conditions, and the method to use (`method`). For Euler's Method, it uses a simple forward difference formula to update the approximation of the solution and its derivative at each step. For the Adams-Bashforth method, it incorporates multiple previous values of the solution and its derivative to improve accuracy. This function is useful for numerically solving second-order ODEs and obtaining approximations of the solutions.

The `compute_ode_errors` function calculates the errors associated with different numbers of subintervals for both Euler's Method and the Adams-Bashforth method. It takes inputs such as the range of subinterval values ($N$), the function representing the ODE, the initial conditions, and the method to use (`method`). It calculates the error between the numerical solution and the true solution for each number of subintervals and plots the results. This function helps in assessing the convergence and accuracy of the numerical methods for solving ODEs. The plot generated by this function provides insights into the convergence rate and potential limitations of the methods.

Numerical methods are essential for approximating solutions to mathematical problems. They include techniques for numerical integration and solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Numerical integration methods, such as the composite trapezium rule, estimate definite integrals accurately. When solving ODEs, methods like Euler's Method and the Adams-Bashforth method are commonly used. By converting higher-order ODEs into systems of first-order ODEs, these methods provide effective approximations.
