## Numerical Integration

The `composite_trapezium` function approximates the definite integral of a given function \(f(x)\) over a specified interval \([a, b]\) using the composite trapezium rule with \(n\) subintervals. The composite trapezium rule divides the interval into smaller subintervals, approximates the integral over each subinterval using the trapezium rule, and sums up the results to estimate the total integral. This function is useful for obtaining reasonably accurate approximations of integrals without requiring complex mathematical calculations.

The composite trapezium rule equation is given by:

\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx \approx \frac{h}{2} \left[ f(a) + 2\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} f(x_j) + f(b) \right]

where \(h\) is the width of each subinterval, \(x_j\) is the midpoint of the \(j\)-th subinterval, and \(f(a)\) and \(f(b)\) are the function values at the endpoints of the interval.

To use the `composite_trapezium` function, you need to provide the function \(f(x)\), the interval limits \(a\) and \(b\), and the number of subintervals \(n\). The function will return an approximation of the integral.

The composite trapezium rule is an improvement over the basic trapezium rule as it takes into account the curvature of the function over each subinterval, resulting in more accurate approximations.

By adjusting the value of \(n\), you can control the trade-off between computational cost and accuracy. Increasing \(n\) will generally lead to a more accurate approximation but will also require more computational resources.

Using the `composite_trapezium` function, you can easily approximate integrals of various functions and evaluate definite integrals over a specified interval.

The `romberg_integration` function performs Richardson extrapolation to estimate the definite integral of a function \(f(x)\) over an interval \([a, b]\) using the composite trapezium rule with increasing levels of extrapolation. Richardson extrapolation combines multiple approximations with different step sizes to improve accuracy. The `level` parameter determines the number of extrapolation stages to perform. This function is useful for obtaining highly accurate estimates of definite integrals, especially for functions with smooth behavior.

The `compute_errors` function calculates the errors associated with different numbers of subintervals and levels in the Romberg integration process and visualizes the results in a plot. It takes a range of subinterval values (\(N\)) and levels of extrapolation (\(levels\)) as inputs and calculates the error between the approximate integral and the true value for each combination. This function helps in assessing the convergence and accuracy of the Romberg integration method for a specific function and interval. The plot generated by this function provides insights into the convergence rate and potential limitations of the Romberg integration method.

## Numerical ODEs - One-step and Multistep methods

One-step methods are numerical techniques for approximating solutions to differential equations, where the value \(y_{i+1}\) is computed solely based on the information from the previous time level \(t_i\). However, there are also multistep methods that use more historical information to determine \(y_{i+1}\). A general \(m\)-step method, with step-length \(h\), is shown below:

\[
y_{i+1} = y_i + h \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} a_k f(t_{i-k}, y_{i-k})
\]

for some coefficients \(a_k\).

The Adams-Bashforth family of methods is a group of multistep methods. The 1-step Adams-Bashforth method coincides with the Euler method, while the 2-step method utilizes information from two previous time points, resulting in a formula for \(y_{i+1}\) that includes terms \(y_i\) and \(y_{i-1}\):

\[
y_{i+1} = y_i + \frac{h}{2} \left[3f(t_i, y_i) - f(t_{i-1}, y_{i-1})\right]
\]

where \(h\) is the step size and \(y_0 = f(t, y)\) is the first-order differential equation being solved.
